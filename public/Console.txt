[Warning] You are loading Turbolinks from a <script> element inside the <body> element. This is probably not what you meant to do! (application-8d219eb64a05bcfb841b.js, line 26107)

Load your application’s JavaScript bundle inside the <head> element instead. <script> elements in <body> are evaluated with each page change.
